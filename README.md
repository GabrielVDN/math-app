# Math-App

This project is a Tkinter GUI of a math practicing tool.
This was inspired by https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/32003/Multiplication-Table-Practice-Tool.
Me and my brother would learn the tables of multiplication on it and know I made a app that looks like it, just better ;)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

First of start with cloning the git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/GabrielVDN/math-app.git
```

Change your working directory:

```

activate it:
